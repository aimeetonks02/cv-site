            <p>Currently, I&apos;m in my third year at Keele University doing my Computer Science (Software
            Engineering) degree and I&apos;m due to graduate in the summer of 2024. I am hoping to recieve
            either a 2:1 or a 1st and have been putting my all into my degree because of this.</p><br/>
            <p>Outside of learning, I work in the kitchen at the Student&apos;s Union to gain a bit of 
              extra money alongside my studies as I don&apos;t have any student finance left after paying rent.
