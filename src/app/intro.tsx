            <p>Currently, I&apos;m in my third year at Keele University completing my degree in BSc Computer Science (Software
            Engineering) and I&apos;m due to graduate in the summer of 2024. I am hoping to recieve
            either a 2:1 or a 1st and have been putting my all into my degree to ensure this.</p><br/>
            <p>Outside of learning, I work in the kitchen at the Student&apos;s Union to gain a bit of 
              extra money alongside my studies, and also enjoy my more creative hobbies like drawing and reading.
